You can configure one or more peer servers here.
Each server configuration should be placed within <servers></servers> tag.
Server configuration example:
<server>
    <url>http://localhost:8083/nexus</url>
    <user>admin</user>
    <password>admin123</password>
</server>

User and password are optional. If there is neither login nor password (or login is empty) server will use anonymous user.
You could also define myUrl attribute for <configurations> tag that defines URL of the Nexus instance.
Remote URL of the proxy repository (at the peer instance) should start with myUrl (configured for master instance).
This configuration used to match what proxy repository have to poll artifact.

requestsQueueSize and requestsSendingThreadsCount attributes define thread pool configuration. This pool is used to send
requests from master to peers asynchronously.
The default values are: 500 for requestsQueueSize and 1 for requestsSendingThreadsCount
