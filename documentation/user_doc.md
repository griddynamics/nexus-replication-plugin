# Sonatype Nexus Replication Plugin

[https://github.com/griddynamics/nexus-replication-plugin](https://github.com/griddynamics/nexus-replication-plugin)

This is Sonatype Nexus plugin that facilitates push-replication to remote proxy repositories when new (Maven) artifacts are stored in a hosted repository.
Let's say you have 2 or more instances of Nexus. When artifact is uploaded to one of them, that Nexus will send notifications to its peers. Then the Receving Nexuses poll the artifact from the original instance.

## Setting up plugin

Plugin should be installed into all Master and Peer Nexus servers.
You may have multiple Nexus instances configured as Masters. They will poll artifacts from each other.

### Master instance

1. Download source from [https://github.com/griddynamics/nexus-replication-plugin](https://github.com/griddynamics/nexus-replication-plugin).
2. Run `mvn package` in root directory (project requires Apache Maven 3.0.4 -- 3.1 and JDK 1.7+).
3. Unzip the `target/nexus-replication-plugin-bundle.zip` file into the plugin-repository directory (located in `$NEXUS_HOME/sonatype-work/nexus/plugin-repository`).
4. Download a sample of the configuration file from [https://github.com/griddynamics/nexus-replication-plugin/blob/master/replication-plugin.xml](https://github.com/griddynamics/nexus-replication-plugin/blob/master/replication-plugin.xml).
5. Copy the `replication-plugin.xml` file into the conf  directory (located in `$NEXUS_HOME/sonatype-work/nexus/conf`).
6. Edit the config file to suit your needs (read instructions inside the file).
7. Restart Nexus.

### Peer instance

You also should configure each Nexus peer instance otherwise they won't poll the uploaded artifact.

1. Reproduce points 1 - 3 from the previous list.
2. Create proxy repository for the each hosted repository (repositories that should be replicated and located in the master Nexus). 
4. Restart Nexus.

## Plugin REST API

Plugin REST API is available at `service/local/artifact/maven/update`. This resource receives POST request with a body like this:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" standalone="yes"?>
<artifact-meta-info>
    <groupId>com.griddynamics.cd</groupId>
    <artifactId>nexus-replication-plugin</artifactId>
    <version>1.0-20150519.140619-2</version>
    <repositoryId>snapshots</repositoryId>
    <extension>jar</extension>
    <nexusUrl>http://localhost:8081/nexus</nexusUrl>
</artifact-meta-info>
```

This method returns XML formatted response. If artifact was resolved successfully response will be:

```xml
<rest-status>
	<isSuccess>true</isSuccess>
	<message>Artifact is resolved.</message>
</rest-status>
```

otherwise `isSuccess` will be false and `message` will contain error description.
